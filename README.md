Everyday Sat
===

My ultimate revenge to the naughty puzzles I couldn't solve as a child.

## How?

This repository uses [Cafesat](https://github.com/regb/cafesat), a SAT solver written in Scala.
Given a (complex) boolean equation, it tries to find a solution that _**sat**isfies_ it.
Most logic based puzzles can be translated to boolean logic and solved this way, as long as the instance size is reasonable.
